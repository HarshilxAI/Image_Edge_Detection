# Image Edge Detection using MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB-based project that extracts and visualizes object boundaries in digital images using multiple image edge detection techniques such as Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny.

The aim of this project is to help students and beginners understand how edge detection works in digital image processing and how it is applied in real-world computer vision systems.
